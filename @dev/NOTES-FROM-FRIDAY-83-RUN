usleep() to prevent mongodb overload? or keep it as an overload switch off mechanism? will need to implement exception handling if second scenario (accurate graphs ; readable output).
VERY INTERESTING : WITH 83, WHEN THE ORGANISM COUNT WENT DOWN AFTER HITTING THE MONGODB QUERY COUNT BARRIER, IT CAME BACK UP. IT KEPT RESTORING ITSELF!! OMG!!
83 seems to be the one.. graph not shown because is innacurate.. when an unhandled exception occurs the organism isn't removed from the db

10000x10000 plane instead?

1. let's try the second scenario and see what the graph is like
2. let's see what happens with usleep()
